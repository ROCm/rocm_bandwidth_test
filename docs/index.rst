ROCm Bandwidth Test documentation
===================================

ROCm Bandwidth Test (RBT) is a ROCm application for reporting system information. RBT captures the performance characteristics of buffer copying and kernel read or write operations. The ``Help`` screen of the benchmark shows various options for initiating copy, read, or write operations.
In addition, you can also query the system's topology in terms of memory pools and their agents.

The code is open source and hosted at: https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_bandwidth_test
