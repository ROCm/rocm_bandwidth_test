ROCm Bandwidth Test documentation
===================================

ROCm Bandwidth Test is a ROCm application for reporting system information.

ROCmBandwidthTest is designed to capture the performance characteristics of buffer copying and kernel read/write operations. The Help screen of the benchmark shows various options one can use in initiating copy/read/writer operations.
In addition, users can also query the topology of the system in terms of memory pools and their agents.
