Introduction:
#############

RocBandwidthTest is designed to capture the performance characteristics of buffer
copying and kernel read/write operations. The help screen of the benchmark
shows various options one can use in initiating cop/read/writer operations.
In addition one can also query the topology of the system in terms of memory
pools and their agents

Build Environment:
##################

To be able to build RocBandwidthTest, users must ensure that the build platform has
following conditions satisfied:

Build Procedure:
################

The following simply lists the steps to build RocBandwidthTest

--- Create a build directory in the project folder - roc_bandwidth_test.

```
$ mkdir ./build
```

--- Set working directory to be the new build directory

```
$ cd ./build
```

--- Invoke Cmake to interpret build rules and generate native build files
    The argument for cmake should be the root folder of RocBandwidthTest
    test suite

```
        // Builds Debug version
        // Assumes pwd is .../roc_bandwidth_test/build
        e.g. cmake -DROCR_LIB_DIR="Path of ROC Runtime Library Files"  \
                   -DROCR_INC_DIR="Path of ROC Runtime Header Files"   \
                   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ..
```

```
        // Builds Release version - default
        // Assumes pwd is .../roc_bandwidth_test/build
        e.g. cmake -DROCR_LIB_DIR="Path of ROC Runtime Library Files"  \
                   -DROCR_INC_DIR="Path of ROC Runtime Header Files"   \
                   ..
```

--- Invoke the native build rules generated by cmake to build the various
    object, library and executable files

```
make
```

--- Invoke the install command to copy build artifacts to pre-defined folders
    of RocBandwidthTest suite. Upon completion artifacts will be copied to the
    bin and lib directories of build directory

```
make install
```

    @note: All executables will be found in <build_directory>/bin folder
