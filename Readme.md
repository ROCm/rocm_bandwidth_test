Introduction:
#############

RocBandwidthTest is designed to capture the performance characteristics of buffer
copying and kernel read/write operations. The help screen of the benchmark
shows various options one can use in initiating cop/read/writer operations.
In addition one can also query the topology of the system in terms of memory
pools and their agents

To be able to build RocBandwidthTest, users must ensure that the build platform has
following conditions satisfied:

Build Procedure:
################

The following simply lists the steps to build RocBandwidthTest

--- Create a build directory in the project folder - roc_bandwidth_test.

        e.g. mkdir ./build

--- Set working directory to be the new build directory

        e.g. cd ./build

--- Invoke Cmake to interpret build rules and generate native build files
    The argument for cmake should be the root folder of RocBandwidthTest
    test suite

        // Builds Debug version
        // Assumes pwd is .../roc_bandwidth_test/build
        e.g. cmake -DROCR_LIB_DIR="Path of ROC Runtime Library Files"  \
                   -DROCR_INC_DIR="Path of ROC Runtime Header Files"   \
                   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ..

        // Builds Release version - default
        // Assumes pwd is .../roc_bandwidth_test/build
        e.g. cmake -DROCR_LIB_DIR="Path of ROC Runtime Library Files"  \
                   -DROCR_INC_DIR="Path of ROC Runtime Header Files"   \
                   ..

--- Invoke the native build rules generated by cmake to build the various
    object, library and executable files

        e.g. make

--- Invoke the install command to copy build artifacts to pre-defined folders
    of RocBandwidthTest suite. Upon completion artifacts will be copied to the
    bin and lib directories of build directory

        e.g. make install

    @note: All executables will be found in <build_directory>/bin folder
