# ROCm Bandwidth Test

ROCm Bandwidth Test is designed to capture the performance characteristics of buffer
copying and kernel read and write operations. The benchmark `help` screen shows various options for initiating copy, read, and write operations.
In addition to this, you can also query the system topology in terms of memory
pools and their agents.
